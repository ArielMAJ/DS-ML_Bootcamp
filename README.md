# DS-ML_Bootcamp
My solutions, projects, code and notes on an Udemy's "Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp".


## Section 01 - Intro

Simple intro (not included here).

## Section 02 - ML overview

Goes through "every" step of a ML problem:

1. Gathers and cleans data;
2. Explores and visualise it;
3. Applies Linear Regression algorithm;
4. Makes predictions/analyses and evaluates the results.

## Section 03 - Python Basics

Starts on the very basics of python and rapidly goes through the necessary things to get you to a level where you can understand Section 02. This was in case you didn't already know much Python at all and wasn't already able to follow what was happening in the last section. This is skippable content.

## Section 04 - Optimization, Gradient Descent and Plotting Graphs (2D and 3D).

Introduces more Python programming concepts, explains what is optimization and teaches the basics of the gradient descent algorithm. These are "the first building blocks to understanding data science".

Among the modules this section explores, numpy and matplotlib are the main ones. This section alone should make you somewhat proficient at plotting 2D and 3D graphs.

Even though this section is somewhat long, not much is explained too thoroughly. Some things may end up feeling a bit confusing. In which case it's best to just google it up. Coursera's Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng is probably best for understanding the workings behind the derivatives and how matrixes are amazing here.

## Section 05 - Multivariate Linear Regression

Everything starts by "formulating a question". Then you gather, clean, explore and visualize the data necessary for answering that question.

Things to get started on understanding the data at hand:

1. Source of the data;
2. Description of the data set;
3. Number of data points;
4. Number of features;
5. Names of the features;
6. Description of the features.
