# DS-ML_Bootcamp
My solutions, projects, code and notes on an Udemy's "Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp".


## Section 01 - Intro

Simple intro (not included here).

## Section 02 - ML overview

Goes through "every" step of a ML problem:

1. Gathers and cleans data;
2. Explores and visualise it;
3. Applies Linear Regression algorithm;
4. Makes predictions/analyses and evaluates the results.

## Section 03 - Python Basics

Starts on the very basics of python and rapidly goes through the necessary things to get you to a level where you can understand Section 02. This was in case you didn't already know much Python at all and wasn't already able to follow what was happening in the last section. This is skippable content.

## Section 04 - Optimization and Gradient Descent

Introduces more Python programming concepts, explains what is optimization and how and teaches the gradient descent algorithm. These are the first building blocks to understanding data science.
